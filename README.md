# Hello Async Rust

Unofficial async Rust tutorial. [>> Read online][1]

## About
It feels good to be able to finish the initial work in the first month of 2025.
The process of the writing helped me to understand the overwhelming topic:
"async Rust". Now it would feel even better if you happen to find the content
useful.

While oversimplified, and not the most accurate, the tutorial might be one of
the easiest to follow. Consider it a tutorial written by a beginner for the
beginners.

Errors or suggestions, please create a PR and it will be merged immediately.
